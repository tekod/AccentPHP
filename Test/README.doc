Testing environment
===============================

Tests of AccentPHP components are based on simpletest testing libraray
(included in package).

Package contains mini web application to run available tests (./Test.php) 
but it cannot be called directly becouse package (together with other packages)
need to be in protected part of hosting.

In order to execute testing application you must create new php file in 
document_root, arbitrary named, with folowing content:

<?php // entry for AccentPHP test platform
  define('ACCENTTEST_PASSWORD', '123456');
  include '../Vendor/Accent/Test/Test.php';
?>

Please, make these two modifications before saving file:
  - set password with something unique, 
  - redirect path to point to correct location of test package

Don't worry that you may forget it 
because in that case you can always look in this file.
Ofcourse, comment is not mandatory but helps later, as reminder, to describe 
you for what purpose you create this file.
