Event
=====

In order to dispatch event there have to be instantied "event object" that can store some values (like DTO) allowing listeners to access/modify them.
Altrough that was recomanded it is optional. 
Some events are just "signals", they inform others that specified event was happen, without any parameter. Send "null" as parameter for such events.
Some events does not expect returning values, they just inform listeners in immutable way about something. Send array of key-values for such events.

Order of listeners execution can be adjusted using last parameter in AttachListener method.

Listener can terminate execution of event and left other listeners unexecuted by returning true at end of method.

Class Component has method EventDispatch() as shorthand for typical: $this->GetService('Event')->Execute(...)
