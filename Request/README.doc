Request Component
====================


Request handles interaction with running enviroment.
Enviroment is represented as context in which target controller will be executed.
Such construction allowing creation of sub-requests with modified enviroment variables
which will put targeting controller in quite different context then original HTTP request.

Controllers and methods should use Request to:
 - get current URL
 - get supplied $_GET and $_POST vars
 - get info about server (OS,CGI,SAPI,...)
 - get info about user (IP address, browser_user_agent,...)

This component should not be used as service, instead inject it's instance
(or make it accessible in another way) in constructor of other objects.
That way ensure isolation of thread "kernel-request-router-controler" from laters
sub-requests, or even sub-applications.
If you use Request as service it will be imposible to differentiate contexts
for main and sub-requests.
