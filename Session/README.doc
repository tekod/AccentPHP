Session Component
====================

Session package encapsulate common functions for basic managing of visitors data.

This package offers several built-in storage engines for visitor's variables,
allowing developers to choose best solution for each project or to use theirs custom engine.

Session internally use cookies to identify visitor.
Content of cookie is random generated string which will be used as key for retrieving
data from storage. Developer can configure component to periodically change that key.

Stored visitor's data are persistent between HTTP requests but have general lifetime
to prevent occuping too much hosting resources.

ReadOnce session variables are special type of variables, they are persistent between
requests but gets destroyed after first fetching thru GetData method.

This component does not implement so called "flash" variables.
Why? Becouse ReadOnce concept is better replacement for same tasks flash vars using for.
Flash stores a value and lets you retrieve it in the next request. The problem is that
the next request may not be what you think it is.
It might be another browser tab/window from the same user. It might be an AJAX request.
It might be a JS script or CSS file served up by your application (via a controller).
In addition, extra redirects/forwards can cause confusion with flash and/or data to be
"used up" in the wrong request.
