Cache Component
====================

Class Cache provides access to various formats and sources of configuration data.

Persistance of data is delegated to Accent\Storage\Storage component that is most suited fot this job.
Because of its large number of built-in drivers cache can be stored in various locations:
in database, in filesystem, in memory, in external services, nowhere,...

Usage of "cache tags" makes cache invalidations very easy to achieve.
Most Storage drives supports tags.

Select name storage engine using contructor option "Storage" (default value is "php" 
which meaning that PhpDriver will be used and file will contain ".php" extension).

Other options will be used to cofigure storage drivers, see default-options 
of each driver to find what options you need to specify in constructor.

Example setting up simple cache using files as storage:
$Cache= new Cache([
    'Storage'=> 'File',
    'Path'   => __DIR__.'/../data/cache', // unique storage directory
    'Ext'    => '.dat', // alter file extension of cache file
]);

.. or database:
$Cache= new Cache([
    'Storage'=> 'db',
    'Table'=> 'Cache',
]);
