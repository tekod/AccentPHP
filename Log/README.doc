Log service
====================

This service provides mechanisms for logging (acquisation and storing)
arbitrary informations for later analysing.

Multiple "writers" can be attached in logging process to make flexibile
handling of messages with different importances.

Purpose of acquisitors is to attach additional data to each message on-fly.
